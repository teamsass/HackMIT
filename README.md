# HackMIT

## How to Play

### Getting it working

If Python 3 is installed on your computer, then run
```
python3 quietgame.py
```
Otherwise, go into bin and find the file named "quietgame" and double click

### Controls

After the title screen, the first thing you need to do is click AIM. This will bring up a marker which helps you see which direction the ball will move in. 

Then, click POWER and yell as loud as you wish (try to get it into the white hole). 

If you want to continue in the same direction, simply click POWER and repeat. Otherwise, you must reAIM.

Repeat until you WIN!
